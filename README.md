Installation
There are no specific libraries required to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code is compatible with Python version 3 and should run without issues.

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in analysing 2024 Stack Overflow developer survey dataset to see what are other developers around world doing, from the coding lnanguage to working pattern, finally to reveal any factors that could drive into developer's salary, giving helpful insights to either developers or employers. After the initail exploration on the dataset, I came up with three business questions that sparked my interest the most. Thus, digging out insights on these questions serves as the purposes for my analysis:

What are the most popular programming languages among developers?
Does people work from home earn more or less than people work on-site in UK?
What are the most influential factors on developer salary in UK?

File Descriptions
3 notebooks, one for each individual question, are available to walk through the analysis about business questions mentioned above. The CSV file is the original datasets downloaded from Stack Overflow offical website and used in this study.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the plog on [Medi](https://medium.com/@jiamin.mao/what-impacts-developers-salary-9a05950f8c20).
